;;; Commentary:

;; The `notmuch-notify' function will search using notmuch all
;; messages tagged with the tags 'notification' and 'unread'. For
;; every message, it will send a notification using notify-send
;; consisting of the author(s) and the subject of the message.
;; Finally, it removes the 'notification' tag from those messages.

(defun notmuch-notify-command-default (msg)

This is a function with a message as a parameter, that must

The message is a plist with the following attributes: `:thread',
`:timestamp', `:date_relative', `:matched', `:total', `:authors',
`:subject', `:query', `:tags'."
